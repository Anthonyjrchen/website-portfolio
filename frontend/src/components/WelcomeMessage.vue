        <p class="text-xl w-[700px] text-center">Since I started programming 5 years ago, I've completed many
            projects, partook in many events such as Capture the Flags, game development 
            competitions, and more. So far, I've completed two client request projects: DAhandler, and 
            a secured data trading platform. Feel free to explore these in my works section!
